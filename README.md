Hello Everyone,

These are the list of steps that you need to do for successfully creating your own server for interaction :-

1. Log in to the web app
2. Now create a server by uploading a display picture and giving a name to the server.
3. Now you have entered in the channel then the drop down arrow just right to the server name on the almost top right gives you the access to a few things like Invite people, manage members, server settings and etc.
4. You can also create different type of channels like text, audio and video from the drop down and can also delete the server if you are the admin.
5. A new server can be created by clicking the top right corner + button which will also allow you to manage the one to one chat settings by hiding the members or making them visible for ensuring the privacy of the 
   server and keeping it a team interaction panel only.

There is also a one to one chat option by clicking on the member name and a new panel will be opened to interact with him/her only.

The video and audio calls could be placed via the created channels and this is possible due to the livekit api.


So feel free to invite anyone and enjoy the chat app.

Note : Since it is deployed on render hence it might face a few issues because it is not a paid plan, So please avoid a few delays because you might face them at a few points.
